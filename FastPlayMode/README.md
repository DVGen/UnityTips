# Fast Play Mode
Want to enter play mode faster in Unity? Starting with Unity 2019.3, you can disable a few options to enter play mode almost immediately. 
It is a big time saver during development. There are times when you still want to use the standard Domain Reload and Scene Reload options, 
so be sure to check out Unity's information below.

The file EditorPlayModeSettings can be placed anywhere in your project.
However, the file EditorPlayModeSettingsInspector MUST be placed in an Editor folder.
See Unity's docs on special folder names: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html
